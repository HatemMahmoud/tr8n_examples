= Welcome to Tr8n Translation Engine Examples Application

Tr8n translation engine is a rails engine plugin that provides a framework for crowd-source translations and management of any internationalized text 
throughout any rails based application. The power of the engine comes from its simple and friendly user interface that allows site users 
to rapidly translate the site into hundreds of languages. The flexible and robust rules engine that powers Tr8n allows for any combinations 
of language specific rules in any translatable sentence. Users themselves can provide information on what sentences depend on gender rules, 
number rules or other types of rules supported by the engine. The language specific rules can be registered and managed for any language in 
the advanced user interface. The engine also provides a set of powerful admin tools that allow admins to manage any aspect of the engine; 
enabling and disabling its features and monitoring translation process.

The Tr8n engine itself is based on a very robust and flexible pluggable architecture where rule types and even syntax of the "tr" tokens 
can be configured or extended for any application deployment.

Tr8n translation engine has been successfully deployed by the following companies:

= Installation Instructions

The best way to get going with Tr8n is to run it in a stand-alone mode first, try out some translations 
and then read the specification document, which will guide through the process of integrating Tr8n into your application.

To run Tr8n in a stand-alone mode, run the following commands:

  $ git clone git://github.com/berk/tr8n_examples.git
  $ cd tr8n_examples
  $ rake db:migrate
  $ rake tr8n:init
  $ rails server

The above commands will create a development sqlite3 database in the db folder of tr8n, init the database and run the local web server. Now you can open your browser and point to:

  http://localhost:3000
