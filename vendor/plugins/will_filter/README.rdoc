= WillFilter

will_filter is a Rails engine plugin that extends the functionality of will_paginate by adding filters to your pages.

== Preamble
 
If you ever had to build an admin tool for your web site that displayed a list of objects that can be filtered using 
various criteria, this plugin will make your life easier. Adding a filtered page can now be 
a matter of adding two lines of code - one to your controller and one to your view. See examples below.

For advanced samples of how to use the filters, please download and install the following project: 

http://github.com/berk/will_filter_examples

== Installation Instructions

Install the latest version of the will_paginate plugin or gem created by Mislav MarohniÄ‡. 

  $ script/plugin install git://github.com/mislav/will_paginate.git

To install, configure and initialize will_filter engine, run the following commands: 

  $ script/plugin install git://github.com/berk/will_filter.git
  $ rake will_filter:sync  
  $ rake db:migrate 

  $ cd public; ln -s ../vendor/plugins/will_filter/public/wf wf

== Examples

To add a filtered resultset to your controller use the following method call:

  class OrderController < ApplicationController
  
    def index
      @orders = Order.filter(:params => params)    
    end
    
  end  

Note: 'Profile' is a Rails ActiveRecord model 

Now all you have to do is create a view for this action and add the following tag where you want the filter to be rendered:

  <%= will_filter(@orders) %>
	
And optionally you can do (for results table):
	
  <%= will_filter_table_tag(@orders) %>


That's it. This will render a filter box with various conditions, operators and values for the model object you selected.


Below are a couple of screenshot of what the filter looks like when it is rendered on a page:
