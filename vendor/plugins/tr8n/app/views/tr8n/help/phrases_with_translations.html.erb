    The top ten translations for each phrase are listed. The rank indicates how many users have voted for the translation (+1 for up votes, -1 for down votes). Use the thumbs to vote a translation up or down. Report a translation to remove it from the list of translations and put the translator on a watch list. This should only be used when the translation is intentionally incorrect or offensive.

    If you don't like any of the translations listed, use the view all link to find another translation to vote up or use the translate it yourself link to add a better translation.
