    When you enable inline translations you'll notice that all translatable phrases are underlined in various colors:
  </p>
    
  <ul>
    <li>Red - The phrase has not yet been translated for this language</li>
    <li>Yellow - The phrase has been translated in a <%= tr8n_help_link("fallback language") %></li>
    <li>Green - The phrase has been translated into this language</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Right-click (or Control-click on a Mac) on a phrase to translate it. See <%= tr8n_help_link("Translating Inline") %> for more details.
