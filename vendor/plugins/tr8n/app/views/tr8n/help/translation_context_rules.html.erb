    Translations for some phrases can depend on the gender of the user viewing the translation and the gender or numerical value of tokens in the phrase. For example, in some languages "Invite Family & Friends to View Your Tree" has two different translations, one if the viewer is male and one if they are female. Tokens are parts of the phrase that are not translated, such as a profile name or a number. The translation for "{actor} tagged {target} in {count} photos" can depend on the gender of the actor and target as well as the number of photos. Tokens themselves are not translated. Geni will automatically replace them with the actual value.
