= Welcome to Tr8n Translation Engine

Tr8n Translation Engine is a Rails engine plugin that provides a framework for crowd-source translations and management of any internationalized text 
throughout any Rails based application. The power of the engine comes from its simple and friendly user interface that allows site users 
to rapidly translate the site into hundreds of languages. The flexible and robust rules engine that powers Tr8n allows for any combination 
of language specific rules in any translatable sentence. Users themselves can provide information on what sentences depend on gender rules, 
number rules or other rules supported by the engine. The language specific rules can be registered and managed for any language in 
the advanced user interface. The engine provides a set of powerful admin tools that allow admins to manage any aspect of the engine; 
enabling and disabling its features and monitoring translation process.

The Tr8n engine itself is based on a very robust and flexible pluggable architecture where rule types and the syntax of the "tr" tokens 
can be configured or extended for any application deployment.

Tr8n translation engine has been successfully deployed by the following companies:

Geni Inc, http://www.geni.com

Yammer Inc, http://www.yammer.com 

You can visit their web sites and see how it is being used. If your company is using Tr8n, please let me know and i will add you to the list.

= Installation Instructions

Tr8n is mostly self-contained. The only two plugins it depends on are will_paginate created by Mislav MarohniÄ‡ for results pagination 
and will_filter created by me for filtering results in the admin interface. 

To install the required plugins, run the following commands:

  $ script/plugin install git://github.com/mislav/will_paginate.git
  
  $ script/plugin install git://github.com/berk/will_filter.git
  $ rake will_filter:sync  
  $ rake db:migrate 
  $ cd public; ln -s ../vendor/plugins/will_filter/public/wf wf; cd ..;

To install, configure and initialize Tr8n engine, run the following commands: 

  $ script/plugin install git://github.com/berk/tr8n.git
  $ rake tr8n:sync         
  $ rake db:migrate 
  $ rake tr8n:init
  $ cd public; ln -s ../vendor/plugins/tr8n/public/tr8n tr8n; cd ..;

= Integration Instructions

The best way to get going with Tr8n is to run it in a stand-alone mode first, try out some translations 
and then read the specification document, which will guide through the process of integrating Tr8n into your application.

To run Tr8n in a stand-alone mode, run the following commands:

  $ git clone git://github.com/berk/tr8n.git
  $ cd tr8n
  $ rake db:migrate
  $ rake tr8n:init
  $ script/server

The above commands will create a development sqlite3 database in the db folder of tr8n, init the database and run the local web server. Now you can open your browser and point to:

  http://localhost:3000/tr8n

Congratulations! You are now running Tr8n in the stand-alone mode!


= Sample Application

You can now get the source code for a sample application that runs Tr8n in the integrated mode and start from there:

  $ git clone git://github.com/berk/tr8n_examples.git
  $ cd tr8n_examples
  $ rake db:migrate
  $ rake tr8n:init
  $ script/server

Live Tr8n sample application is running here:
